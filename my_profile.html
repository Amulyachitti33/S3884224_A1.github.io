                                <h2>About me</h2>
                            </header>
                            <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Amulya Reddy Chitti and my friends call me Amu. I was born and brought up in India. Apart from English, I can speak Telugu and Hindi
                                I was pretty good at academics and extracurricular activities. I used to participate in almost every fest and competiton. I love playing basketball and participated in basketball competitons.
                                And not just that, I used to volunteer at Blue Cross, Hyderabad; it's an organisation for the welfare of animals.
                            </p>
                            <p>One of the best hobbies I recently got into was reading books. A few of my favourite books are 'You Deserve Better' by Annie Marie, 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck' by Mark Manson, 
                                and 'The Kite Runnner' by Khaled Hosseini. Also, dance is another hobby that I love the most; it makes me feel serene and pleasant. During my passtime, I watch movies of different languages; English, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. And also, I desire to travel more and more, as I believe that travelling is the best way to know yourself and learn about different cultures and people.
                            </p>

                        </header>
                        <p>I took some time to decide what to study and did a lot of research. I finally decided to study Information Technology as it really fascinated me. I speculate it teaches a lot of new things and to be up to date in this era of technology. I want to learn about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and how to apply Artificial Intelligence in different fields like healthcare, retail, sports activities, and security and surveillance.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the Covid pandemic, I watched many videos and read articles about how Information technology is evolving and how it's changing the lives of everyone from all around the world. And how Artificial Intelligence is a massive part of our daily lives. So, I decideed to choose Information Technology and study programmming languages, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, and Machine Learning. </p>

                        </header>
                        <p>I researched other universities like Swinburne, La Trobe, Monash University. Still, I decided to study at RMIT University because it offers the course I'm interested in and is a QS Star Rated global university.
                            And I love to participate in social activities. And RMIT has many different student clubs to choose from, like RUSU, RMIT Indian club, dance club, sports club, political, creative, and spiritual clubs. I have already signed up for RUSU and dance classes. And studies here are both practical and theoretical, making it easier to learn and understand.
                            It prepares us for the real world. And I believe the faculty here are supportive and helpful. RMIT University is also within walking distance of restaurants, cafes, parks, and sport facilities.

                        <p>I look ahead to learning courses like Java, Python, SQL, web programming, networking, machine learning, foundations of AI, and mathematics, which includes Calculus, linear algebra. And not just that, I anticipate developing
                            skills like communication skills, working in a team, and problem-solving skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>I yearn to develop not just IT skills but also social skills and have the most significant memories and learn new aspects.</p>

                        <h2>Overview:</h2>
                        <p>My project idea is an application for the mental well-being of people. This app is for people who can't afford face-to-face theraphy, and hence, they can have online sessions.
                         The AI assistant will guide them and look after their mental health. They can have multiple sessions but have to book appointments ahead.
                         In this applicaton, we can record data, including health conditions, food diets, and sleep patterns. It also records the progress of the patient. 
                         For emergency purposes, that is, having a panic attack,anxiety outbreak, etc., they can double-click the volume up button, and we will send emergency support.</p>
                        <h2>Motivation:</h2>
                        <p>My whole idea behind the application is that everyone needs theraphy irrespective of how deep their pain is, but many people cna't afford it as it is expensive or time-consuming; travelling time.
                            And few of them are scared to come forward and take theraphy. So this online theraphy is affordable; to be more precise, they can have unlimited access at a low price and have access to diets, meditations, exercises, etc.
                            And it secures all their data. They can have multiple online sessions and always seek help. Anyone suffering from anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental illness can use the application. It also suggests nearby hospitals for emergency or serious medical attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>I strive that this will help people and maybe save a few lives.</p>
                        <h2>Description:</h2>
                        <p>In this application, there are various features. First, you have to sign up and mention your details and medical problems. You have to use your facial recognition to confirm and proceed and secure your data. When you put your data, you can book appointments with AI assistance. AI has speech recognition to know your emotions. So, during your online therapy, AI will recognize your speech and make notes of your mental health. Later after the session, it will send you the required food diets, exercises, and medications. A few activities include meditation, yoga, running/walking, and other activities. The application will also report your progress. You can download or watch food recipes and exercises. It also detects your sleep patterns, blood pressure, and heart rate. </p>
                        <p>If you have a sudden panic or anxiety attack, you can double press the volume up button for emergency. It alarms the nearby hospitals or clinics for emergency support.</p>
                        <p>You can also have multiple therapy sessions, twice or thrice a month, or even more.</p>
                        <p>You can view your previous records, which are available in the records menu. 

                            When you open the app, first, it asks for facial recognition, and then on the screen, there are a few tools available; to the right side of the screen, there is a menu bar(three horizontal lines), which includes your profile details, records, help, therapy, and a sign-out option. At the bottom of the screen, there are a few icons like food icons, exercise, sleep patterns, blood pressure, and heart rate icons. If you click each hero, it shows videos of food and activities or reports of your medical health. 
                            </p>
                            <p>You have another feature called SOS. When emergency, double click the volume up button to seek assistance.
                                To start the therapy session, go to the menu, click on therapy, select the reason and click start. It takes you to a video conference panel. 
                                </p>
                                <p>There are two types of subscriptions; free and paid. There are a few benefits for a paid subscription like unlimited therapy sessions, food recipes, exercises videos, regular reviews on sleep patterns, blood pressure, heart rate. And other features like voice recognition, an emergency button is included. However, for a free subscription, voice recognition, food recipes, exercise, and analysis of sleep patterns are unavailable. And also, you will have only one therapy session every month.</p>
                                    <p>These are some of the functional features available on the application. 
                                    </p>
